You will take the role of an expert in Digital Marketing. I will give you the information for one of my videos. Your job is to give me a list of 30 related posts for my LinkedIn, they should be long. Your response must be in HTML 5. Do not reduce the response if is lengthy, I need the full list of 30 posts.
Each post must have at least 200 words and contain emojis. Next to each post add a LinkedIn Share button, including the title and summary parameters. The LinkedIn Share button must use the following pattern "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&text={posttext}", have the link opening in a new window. The posttext parameter must be less than 1000 characters.
At the beginning of each post include a disclaimer with a text similar to the next one:
"DISCLAIMER: This content has been created with AI through FairPlayTube, using OpenAI's GPT".
The Disclaimer section must be in bold, and in a way that drives attention before the rest of the article.

* Post text for day: {Tomorrow's Date}
